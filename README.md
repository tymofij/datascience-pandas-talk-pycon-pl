# Data Science toolkit: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn

These are the notebooks for a PyconPL talk about basics of doing data science in Python, 
using Kaggle's [Predict survival on the Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) as an example task.

## Notebooks

* [Importing data and processing it with NumPy](NumPy_data_importing.ipynb)
* [Doing EDA with Pandas](Pandas_EDA.ipynb)
